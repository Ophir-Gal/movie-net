      <h2 class="u_title">The Rationale for My Design</h2>
      <h3>How I Chose My Particular Visual Encodings and Interaction
      Techniques</h3>
      I've given a lot of thought (over a couple of days) to how I could 
      create an interactive visualization that's useful for me. I thought, 
      since my family likes to watch a lot of movies, that it would be nice 
      if I could create a tool that helps one find movies to watch, that's 
      differnet than tools that already exist. I realized that there aren't 
      really interactive tools out there that visualize the relationship 
      between people with similar tastes in movies. I then came up with the 
      idea to create a network chart to allow one to see movies that people 
      with similar tastes like. I also wanted them to be able to explore the 
      data set through the interaction, so I wanted nodes of the network to be 
      clickable, draggable, and able to display more information. Based on that,
      I defined my research question as: "how can I make it easier for people to 
      find a movie to watch, based on what people with similar tastes like?"
    </p>
    <h3>The Alternatives I Considered and How I Arrived at My Ultimate Choice
    </h3>
    The other types of charts I've considered are: a chord diagram, an arc 
    diagram, edge bundling, and a heat map. Like networks, these charts can 
    also visualize relationships between data objects. Networks however, 
    especially interactive ones, are not only more intuitive in many cases, but
    they are also better suited for exploring the data via jumping from one 
    relationship to the next.
    <h2 class="u_title">Dataset</h2>
    I chose the <strong>MovieLens Latest Dataset (the small version)</strong>. It contains 
    100,000 ratings and 3,600 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 600 
    users. It was last updated in September 2018.<br>

    <!--I chose the <strong>MovieLens 25M Dataset</strong>. It contains 25 million 
    ratings and one million tag applications applied to 62,000 movies by 
    162,000 users. It was released in December 2019.
